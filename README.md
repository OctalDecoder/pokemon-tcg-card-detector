## üöÄ Project Summary

This repository implements a **high-performance Pokemon TCG Pocket card detection and classification pipeline** for real-time screenshot and video input.
The workflow is fully asynchronous and optimized for speed, accuracy, and scalability.

> _Future plans to expand to the full **Pokemon TCG**._

---

## üì∏ Overview & Examples

### 1. Screenshot/Video Ingestion

- Screenshots are pulled from `screenshot_dir` and videos from `videos_dir` (configurable in `config.yaml`).
- Asynchronous pipeline ensures frame acquisition never blocks processing.

---

### 2. YOLOv8 Detection & Tracking

- YOLOv8 identifies cards in each frame, outputting bounding boxes, scores, and class labels (‚Äúfullart‚Äù vs. ‚Äústandard‚Äù).
- Integrated ByteTrack/SORT assigns persistent `track_id`s for robust tracking. _(TODO)_

---

### 3. Fast Duplicate Filtering (pHash Cache)

- Each crop is hashed with a 64-bit perceptual hash (`pHash`). _(TODO)_
- An LRU cache maps each hash to its last label/timestamp. _(TODO)_
- If a crop matches a cached hash recently, CNN inference is skipped. _(TODO)_

---

### 4. Pruned, Quantized & Distilled CNN Classification

- Uncached crops are classified by fast, mobile-ready student CNNs.
- Models distilled from EfficientNet-B0, then pruned and quantized for sub-10 ms inference. _(TODO)_

---

### 5. Asynchronous, Pipelined Architecture

- Detection (YOLO) and classification (CNN) run in parallel CUDA streams.
- A thread-safe queue decouples detection/classification.
- Adaptive batching and buffer limits keep the system responsive, even with many cards.

---

### 6. Configuration & Testing

- Configs (`config.yaml`, `yolo.yaml`, `cnn.yaml`) are hierarchical and centralized.
- Unit tests and sample screenshots reside in `tests/fixtures`.
- `Makefile`, `pytest`, and `requirements.txt` automate setup and CI/CD.

---

### 7. Future Directions

- Mobile model optimization (TinyML)
- Automated ingestion for new expansion packs
- GPU memory profiling, latency tuning, and mixed-precision enhancements
- Continuous benchmarking to maintain <100ms end-to-end latency at high card counts

- Python ‚â• 3.12
- `git` (for cloning, version control)

---

### 2. Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/OctalDecoder/pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-detection.git
cd pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-detection

# Install the requirements
pip install -e .
```

---

### 3. Screenshots for Testing

- Place images to be processed in:
  `tests/fixtures/`
- **To change this location:**
  Edit `config.yaml` ‚Üí `shared` ‚Üí `screenshot_dir`.

---

### 4. Data & Intermediate Model Files

- High-resolution TCG card images live in:
  `data/raw/cards/`
- All temporary checkpoints, embeddings, and intermediate files are created in:
  `data/`

---

### 5. Database Setup

- **Download or obtain** the database (`cards.db`) from \[TBD download link or instructions].
- Place it in:
  `models/cards.db`
- **To change this location:**
  Edit `config.yaml` ‚Üí `shared` ‚Üí `database`

---

### 6. Configuration Structure

- The main configuration file is `config.yaml`.
- The `shared` section merges into all other config sections:

  - _Best practice_: Use `shared` for common variables.
  - **Override priority:**
    `shared` values are populated into all other sections. These individual config sections (e.g., `yolo`, `cnn`) take precedence over `shared` for conflicting values.

---

### 7. Card Image Directory & Naming Convention

- **Base directory:**
  Controlled by `config.yaml` ‚Üí `shared` ‚Üí `card_images_dir`
- **Class subfolders:**
  Must match names in `config.yaml` ‚Üí `shared` ‚Üí `classifiers` (e.g., `fullart`, `standard`)
- **File naming:**
  Place images inside the relevant classifier subfolder, named as `[SeriesID] [CardID].png`

**Example** (for `card_images_dir: data/raw/cards`, `classifiers: fullart, standard`):

```
data/raw/cards/standard/A2b 32.png
data/raw/cards/fullart/S5 100.png
```

---

### 8. Output Directories

- By default, processed images, results, and generated data will be written to:

  - Output dir specified in `config.yaml` ‚Üí `shared` ‚Üí `output_dir`

- Subdirectories (e.g., `output/screenshot_pipeline/`) are automatically created as needed.

---

### 9. Running the Pipeline

To process screenshots and generate results:

```bash
card-detector
```

---

### 10. Work-in-Progress Notes

- Documentation is evolving; structure and locations may shift.
- Database download location is **TBD**.
- Please keep `config.yaml` and directory structure updated if you move or rename files.

## üß™ Real Time Processing Research Suggestions

### YOLOv8 Tracking + pHash Filtering

- **Integrate tracking into YOLOv8**

  - Enable Ultralytics‚Äô built-in tracker (e.g., ByteTrack) so that each detected bounding box gets a persistent `track_id`.
  - For each new detection, immediately compute a perceptual hash (`pHash`) of the cropped card. This should take \~1 ms per crop if using a fast hashing library (e.g., [imagehash](https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/imagehash) with OpenCV preprocess).
  - Maintain a **hash ‚Üí (label, last_seen_frame)** hashtable (LRU-evicted when capacity > 256). After computing `pHash`, look up any existing entry whose Hamming distance ‚â§ Œ¥ (tuning threshold, e.g. Œ¥ = 5 for a 64-bit hash).

    - If a match exists and its `last_seen_frame` is within the last 5 frames, **skip** the CNN forward pass and reuse that label.
    - Otherwise, schedule a CNN inference, then store `(hash, label, current_frame)` in both the per-track cache and the global hashtable.

- **Per-track caching**

  - Maintain `track_id ‚Üí (hash, label, last_seen_frame)`. On each new frame:

    1. If `track_id` is already active AND (frame_difference ‚â§ 5) AND (Hamming distance between current `pHash` and cached `hash` ‚â§ Œ¥), reuse `label`.
    2. If the cached label‚Äôs CNN-confidence dropped below 0.5 (adaptive CNN invocation), force a fresh CNN run even if hash matched.
    3. Otherwise (new track or hash drift), run CNN and update `(hash, label, last_seen_frame)` for that `track_id`.

- **Hashtable (global cache) management**

  - Use a fixed-size LRU (capacity = 256). When inserting a new `(hash ‚Üí label)`, evict the least recently used entry once capacity is exceeded.
  - Update `last_seen_frame` on every reuse to keep hot entries in cache.
  - This prevents the hash table from growing unbounded and ensures lookups remain O(1).

- **Tuning considerations**

  - Choose `pHash` bit-length and Œ¥ so that small lighting or viewpoint changes still fall under the threshold, but different cards do not collide. We may need to experiment with 64-bit versus 128-bit hashing.
  - If two cards have near-identical artwork (e.g., reprints), consider switching to a small embedding (128 D) extracted from a pruned CNN intermediate layer for stricter matching.
  - Always verify that the cost of computing `pHash` (1 ms) plus the dictionary lookup (< 0.1 ms) remains < the cost of a full CNN (10‚Äì20 ms).

---

### Pruning, Quantization & Distillation

- **Model Pruning**

  - Apply PyTorch‚Äôs structured channel pruning (`torch.nn.utils.prune.ln_structured`) on convolutional layers to remove low-magnitude filters. Aim to prune \~30‚Äì40% of channels, then fine-tune on the card dataset to recover any lost accuracy.
  - After pruning, measure FLOPs reduction. Target a \~1.5‚Äì2√ó speedup on GPU inference.

- **Quantization**

  - Export the distilled CNN to ONNX or TorchScript and run **FP16 inference** using NVIDIA‚Äôs TensorRT or PyTorch AMP. FP16 often yields \~2√ó speed improvements over FP32 with negligible accuracy drop.
  - Optionally, calibrate for **INT8** quantization (use a representative calibration set of \~500 card crops). INT8 can be \~3√ó faster, but watch for accuracy loss.
  - Benchmark:

    1. Run a 224√ó224 crop through FP32 ‚Üí measure baseline (\~20‚Äì30 ms).
    2. Convert to FP16 ‚Üí measure (\~10‚Äì15 ms).
    3. Calibrate to INT8 ‚Üí measure (\~7‚Äì10 ms).

  - Automate quantization in the training script so new student models are automatically exported and optimized.

- **Knowledge Distillation into a Lightweight Student**

  - Teacher: the current EfficientNet-B0 (FP32).
  - Student: a smaller backbone such as **MobileNetV3-Small**, **ShuffleNetV2 (1.0√ó)**, or **SqueezeNet1.1**.
  - **Training workflow**:

    1. For each training image, compute teacher logits (soft targets).
    2. Train student with combined loss = CrossEntropy(hard labels) + KLDiv(teacher_logits, student_logits) at temperature T (e.g., T = 4).
    3. Fine-tune student until top-1 accuracy drop ‚â§ 1‚Äì2% compared to teacher.

  - After distillation, benchmark student at 224√ó224 crop: expect \~5‚Äì7 ms per inference on a modern GPU.

- **Input Resolution Tuning**

  - If YOLO crops are tight around each card, resize crops to **128√ó128** or **160√ó160** before feeding the student. Lower resolution often only costs \~1‚Äì2% accuracy but halves FLOPs.
  - Benchmark: compare student accuracy at 128√ó128 vs. 224√ó224 on a held-out set of 1,000 card crops. If acceptable, standardize on the smaller resolution.

- **Single CNN per YOLO Class**

  - We have two YOLO output classes (‚Äúfullart‚Äù vs. ‚Äústandard‚Äù). Maintain a separate student CNN for each. Each student can be specialized:

    - **Fullart_CNN** trained only on full-art card crops.
    - **Standard_CNN** trained only on standard card crops.

  - Benefits: fewer output classes per model allows a smaller classification head and potentially slightly faster inference.

- **Benchmark & Iterate**

  - After pruning/distillation/quantization, measure:

    1. End-to-end inference time for N new crops (e.g., N=10) on GPU.
    2. Compare accuracy to baseline unpruned model.

  - Tweak prune sparsity or student architecture until we hit \~5 ms per crop with ‚â• 97% classification accuracy.

### Asynchronous Pipeline & GPU Pipelines

- **Decouple Detection from Classification**

  1. **YOLO Stage (GPU Stream #1)**

     - Continuously run YOLOv8 detection+tracking on each incoming screenshot (frame). Each result yields `(bbox, track_id, class_label_raw, confidence_raw)`.
     - For each track: compute `pHash` on the CPU immediately (spawn a worker thread if needed).
     - If hash matches cache (distance ‚â§ Œ¥ and cached confidence > 0.8), tag it as ‚Äúlabel_ready‚Äù and skip scheduling to the CNN queue.
     - Else, enqueue the crop to the **Classification Queue** (GPU Stream #2).

  2. **Classification Stage (GPU Stream #2)**

     - Consume crops batch-wise (e.g., batch size 16 or 32) from the queue. Preallocate a single GPU tensor buffer for all incoming crops each iteration.
     - Launch a single batched forward pass for all pending crops (using the appropriate student CNN based on YOLO class).
     - After inference, update per-track cache and global hashtable with `(hash ‚Üí label, confidence, last_seen_frame)`.
     - Return labels to the main thread to overlay on the display or write out results.

Asynchronous I/O & Pipelining

- While **Stream #1** (YOLO) is processing Frame N, **Stream #2** (CNN) should be classifying crops from Frame N‚àí1.
- Use CUDA events or Python‚Äôs `torch.cuda.Stream` to overlap YOLO‚Äôs detection+tracking with the classification stage. This can hide ~10‚Äì20 ms of CNN work behind another detected frame.
- On the CPU side, maintain thread-safe queues for:
  1. **Detection outputs** (bboxes + track_ids + hashes that need CNN).
  2. **Ready labels** (to be rendered or written to disk).
- Ensure the crop extraction and `pHash` computation run on a separate CPU worker thread pool so they don‚Äôt block the main detection loop.

**Buffer Sizing & Backpressure**

- If classification lags behind detection (e.g., many new cards appear suddenly), implement a **max buffer size** (e.g., 64 crops). If the queue fills, either drop low-confidence detections or throttle YOLO (rare).
- Optionally, dynamically adjust crop size or student selection when queue length > threshold: e.g., temporarily switch to a ‚Äútiny‚Äù student model or lower input resolution for faster catch-up.

**Error Handling**

- If a classification batch fails (e.g., OOM), catch the exception, reduce batch size by half, and retry. Log the failure with `logging.error` so we can profile memory constraints.

### üìù Extra Notes

#### üëª Ghost Cards & False Positives

- **Confirmation rule:**  
  Only add a new track to the active dictionary **after** it‚Äôs persisted for 2‚Äì3 consecutive frames OR its CNN confidence > 0.8.  
  If YOLO produces a one-off box with no follow-ups, ignore it (keep it in a ‚Äúpending‚Äù buffer) to avoid caching spurious labels.

#### üîÑ Adaptive CNN Invocation

- If a **cached track‚Äôs CNN confidence drops below 0.5**, force a fresh classification in the next available batch even if `pHash` matches.  
  This catches cards whose visual appearance changed (e.g., glare, damage, rotated).

#### üß† Memory Management for Cache

- **Use an LRU with capacity = 256** entries, keyed by `pHash` (or 128-D embedding).
- Each entry stores: `(label, last_seen_frame, confidence)`.
- Evict the least recently used when inserting a new hash beyond capacity.
- Optionally, keep a separate `track_id ‚Üí hash` map so that when a track ends, we can quickly retire it or deprioritize its hash (though we can still allow the global hash to persist until LRU eviction).

#### üïµÔ∏è Profiling to Identify True Bottlenecks

- **NVIDIA Nsight Systems / PyTorch Profiler**
  - Instrument the YOLO inference step, `pHash` function, crop extraction, and batched CNN inference.
  - Identify if CPU‚ÜíGPU memcpy is dominating. If so, preallocate a pinned (page-locked) buffer for crop tensors and use `torch.cuda.memcpy_async` to overlap with GPU compute.
  - Measure how many milliseconds each stage takes on average. Example breakdown:
    - YOLO detection + tracking: ~10 ms
    - Crop extraction (CPU): ~5 ms for 30 crops
    - `pHash` (CPU): ~1 ms per crop (~30 ms total)
    - Batched CNN (GPU): ~60 ms for 20 crops at 128√ó128 (fp16 student)
    - Overhead (queue/dispatch): ~5 ms
  - If the sum > 100 ms, see which stage is the worst offender and tune accordingly (e.g., batch smaller, prune more, or reduce crop resolution).

---

By combining **tracking + pHash caching**, **pruned+quantized distilled CNNs**, and an **asynchronous pipelined architecture**, we‚Äôll minimize redundant CNN inferences, squeeze maximum throughput out of the GPU, and aim to keep peak frame time under ~100 ms even when dozens of cards appear simultaneously.
